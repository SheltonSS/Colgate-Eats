# Colgate Eats

We hunt ingredients so you don’t have to—your meal's a click away! At Colgate Eats we offer a variety of food assortments, included with the recipes and ingredients you could need. What's better is that if you're craving something and just can't quite put your finger on it, use our preference bar and an AI will generate a meal for you based off of your preferences. 

## What Can We Do!

So far with the website we've built we've offered recipes made by students as well as including some generated ones based off of Colgate student's preferences. It includes badges to inform the user whether the food meets certain dietary restrictions or what not. 

Once we've generated a recipe for you we open up a google form that allows the students to sign up for a cruiser, in collaboration with our Student Government Association, that sends you on a route to multiple stores where the ingredients can be located. 

Not only does the food contain recipes and instructions for mainly how to create the food, but it also creates a personalized meal for you using preference sliders that can be customized into anything. Taking into account the time of day, sweetness, heaviness, and even more.

## Future Ideas

We would love to implement an account system to save the user's preferences and allow it to make a more personalized experience within the website.

Our vision also includes being able to save certain recipes onto our main home page, and just like any other website, push the most popular recipes that people come up with to the front page!
